            <p class="bildtext">When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the Moon during Apollo 11 in July 1969, he radioed to Earth that the landscape around him had "a stark beauty all its own." The whole Moon is like that. As proof, we offer this bright, young ray impact crater blasted in the eroded wall of the partly buried crater Hedin. It is distant from the starkly beautiful landscape Armstrong saw: the Apollo 11 landing site on Mare Tranquillitatis is more than 1000 kilometers to the east.

            The unnamed crater, just over a mile (1.8 kilometers) across, is too small to see from Earth with unaided eyes.

            The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera imaged this crater on Nov. 3, 2018. The Sun shone from the west (left). This image covers an area about five miles (8.1 kilometers) across.</p>

            <p class="bildtext textH">Due to its spectacular high reflectance rays Aristarchus crater has been a popular landform since telescopes were first pointed towards the Moon. During the Apollo era of exploration much was learned of the wide variety of landforms in this area and it was proposed for a landing site, but the Apollo program was cancelled and humans have yet to visit this fascinating region.

            The Aristarchus crater (about 25 miles or 40 kilometers in diameter) and plateau is one of the most geologically complex areas on the Moon. In this amazing picture, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft slewed 62° (west-to-east) looking across the crater.</p>

            <p class="bildtext textH">Eimmart A, at 4.5 miles (7.3 kilometers) wide, is not large as lunar impact craters go, but its youth and location combine to make it spectacular. Because it is young — excavated by an asteroid or comet impact in the late Copernican, probably less than 100 million years ago — its rim is sharp, its impact melt flows and ponds are obvious, and the boulders strewn over the surface around it are prominent.</p>

            <p class="bildtext">Ranger 8 camera B image of the Moon about 5 seconds before impact. Ranger 8 impact took place on 20 February 1965 at 9:57:37 UT. This picture was taken from a distance of 11 km. The area is in the Sea of Tranquillity about 2 degrees north of the Apollo 11 landing site. The frame is about 2 km across and north is up. Features as small as 4 meters across can be seen. (Ranger 8, B090)</p>

            <p class="bildtext textH">Astronaut David R. Scott, commander, gives a military salute while standing beside the deployed United States flag during the Apollo 15 lunar surface extravehicular activity (EVA) at the Hadley-Apennine landing site. The flag was deployed toward the end of EVA-2. The Lunar Module (LM), "Falcon," is partially visible on the right. Hadley Delta in the background rises approximately 4,000 meters (about 13,124 feet) above the plain. The base of the mountain is approximately 5 kilometers (about three statue miles) away. This photograph was taken by astronaut James B. Irwin, lunar module pilot. While astronauts Scott and Irwin descended in the LM to explore the moon, astronaut Alfred M. Worden, command module pilot, remained in lunar orbit in the Command and Service Modules (CSM).</p>
