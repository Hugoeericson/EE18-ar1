        <p>George Miller (born 18 September 1992[2]), better known by his stage name Joji and formerly by his online aliases Filthy Frank and Pink Guy, is a Japanese singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer, author, and former Internet personality and comedian.</p>
        <p>Miller's start as an entertainer began on his now defunct YouTube channels, DizastaMusic, TooDamnFilthy, and TVFilthyFrank,[10] that consisted of rap songs, rants, extreme challenges, ukulele performances[11] and a bizarre show titled The Filthy Frank Show, with most of the main characters played by Miller, including the titular character of Filthy Frank.[12][13] To complement his TVFilthyFrank channel, Miller produced comedy hip hop music under his Pink Guy alias, who is also a zentai-wearing recurring character on The Filthy Frank Show, with his songs featured on the show and his discography spanning two full-length projects and an extended play. Miller's videos had widespread impact, including starting a viral dance craze known as the Harlem Shake, which was directly responsible for the debut of Baauer's "Harlem Shake" song atop the Billboard Hot 100.[14][15] Many YouTube personalities have made major or cameo appearances on The Filthy Frank Show, including h3h3Productions, iDubbbz, JonTron, Michael Stevens, and PewDiePie.[16][17][18]</p>
